## Email Delivery Status

⚠️ **Email delivery requires SMTP configuration**

The `send-nip3-results` edge function has been created and deployed, but email delivery failed due to missing SMTP credentials in your Supabase project.

### To Enable Email Delivery:

1. Log into your Supabase project dashboard
2. Go to: **Settings → Edge Functions → Secrets**
3. Add these environment variables:
   - `SMTP_HOST` (e.g., smtp.gmail.com)
   - `SMTP_PORT` (e.g., 587)
   - `SMTP_USER` (your email address)
   - `SMTP_PASSWORD` (your email password or app-specific password)

4. Once configured, run:
   ```bash
   node send-email.cjs
   ```

### Alternative Delivery Methods:

Since email isn't working yet, you can:
- Open `nip3-test-results.html` in a browser and manually send to recipients
- Share the HTML file directly via file transfer
- Copy the contents and paste into an email
