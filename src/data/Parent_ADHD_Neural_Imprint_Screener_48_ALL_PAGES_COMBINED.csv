"This questionnaire helps you notice patterns in how your child or teenager focuses, manages energy, handles emotions, and responds to school and life demands. It links their behaviours to 16 Neural Imprint Patterns (such as Mind Matters, Burned Out, Addictive Loops, Shattered Worth, etc.).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Important: This is NOT a diagnosis of ADHD. Only a qualified health professional (such as a psychologist, psychiatrist, or medical doctor) can diagnose ADHD. This tool is designed for parent or caregiver reflection and coaching. It can highlight where your child may benefit from support, strategies, or a professional assessment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"How to answer:
• Think about your child’s behaviour over the last 6–12 months.
• Answer based on how they are MOST of the time, not on a single good or bad day.
• There are no right or wrong answers – be as honest and objective as you can.
• Use the scale: 1 = Does not describe my child at all, 4 = Describes my child completely.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
