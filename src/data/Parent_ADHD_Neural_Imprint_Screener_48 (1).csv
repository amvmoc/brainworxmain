Parent / Caregiver ADHD-Linked Neural Imprint Screener (Ages 12–18)
"Instructions:
Rate each statement from 1 to 4 using the dropdown in the 'Responses' sheet.
Scale: 1 = Strongly disagree, 2 = Somewhat disagree, 3 = Somewhat agree, 4 = Strongly agree.
After entering all 50 responses, go to the 'Report' sheet to see your Radar and Bar charts.

Notes for Coach (hidden mapping kept inside workbook):
- Each statement contributes to a Hardwire dimension (e.g., MOM, UP, LIB, etc.).
- Scores are simple sums across items mapped to each Hardwire.
- Color thresholds (you can adjust in 'Scores'):
   Green: <= 40% of max per Hardwire
   Yellow: 41%–70%
   Red: > 70%

"Important: This is NOT a diagnosis of ADHD. Only a qualified health professional (such as a psychologist, psychiatrist, or medical doctor) can diagnose ADHD. This tool is designed for parent or caregiver reflection and coaching. It can highlight where your child may benefit from support, strategies, or a professional assessment."

"How to answer:
• Think about your child’s behaviour over the last 6–12 months.
• Answer based on how they are MOST of the time, not on a single good or bad day.
• There are no right or wrong answers – be as honest and objective as you can.
• Use the scale: 1 = Does not describe my child at all, 4 = Describes my child completely."
