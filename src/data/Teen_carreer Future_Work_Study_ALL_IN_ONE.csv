Instructions,Teen Future Work & Study Direction Screener (Neural Imprint based),,,,
Instructions,,,,,
Instructions,"This assessment is for teenagers who want to understand what kind of future work and study paths might fit them best. It looks at your interests, the type of environments you function well in, how you like to learn, and some patterns that might help or hinder your future choices.",,,,
Instructions,,,,,
Instructions,,,,,
Instructions,,,,,
Instructions,"It uses the 16 Neural Imprint Patterns as a background lens, but it is NOT a formal psychometric career test and does NOT replace professional career counselling or psychological assessment. The results are designed for self-reflection, coaching and guided conversations with parents, mentors, teachers or counsellors.",,,,
Instructions,,,,,

Instructions,,,,,
Instructions,,,,,
Instructions,"How to answer:
• Think about how you usually are over the last 6–12 months.
• Answer honestly, not how you think you should be.
• Use the scale 1–4:
   1 = Not at all true of me
   2 = A little true of me
   3 = Often true of me
   4 = Completely true of me
