Personal Development & Mental Health – Hardwire Self-Assessment
"Instructions:
Rate each statement from 1 to 4 using the dropdown in the 'Responses' sheet.
Scale: 1 = Strongly disagree, 2 = Somewhat disagree, 3 = Somewhat agree, 4 = Strongly agree.
After entering all 50 responses, go to the 'Report' sheet to see your Radar and Bar charts.

Notes for Coach (hidden mapping kept inside workbook):
- Each statement contributes to a Hardwire dimension (e.g., MOM, UP, LIB, etc.).
- Scores are simple sums across items mapped to each Hardwire.
- Color thresholds (you can adjust in 'Scores'):
   Green: <= 40% of max per Hardwire
   Yellow: 41%–70%
   Red: > 70%
